***************************
APPLICATION FAILED TO START
***************************

Description:

The dependencies of some of the beans in the application context form a cycle:

   loginSignupController (field private com.study.springboot.service.UserService com.study.springboot.Controller.LoginSignupController.userService)
┌─────┐
|  userService (field private org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder com.study.springboot.service.UserService.passwordEncoder)
↑     ↓
|  securityConfig (field private com.study.springboot.service.UserService com.study.springboot.config.SecurityConfig.userService)
└─────┘


Action:

Relying upon circular references is discouraged and they are prohibited by default. Update your application to remove the dependency cycle between beans. As a last resort, it may be possible to break the cycle automatically by setting spring.main.allow-circular-references to true.
